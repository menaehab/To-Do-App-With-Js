# To-Do App

A simple to-do application that allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The tasks are saved to the browser's local storage, so they persist across page reloads.

## Features

- **Mark Task as Completed**: Clicking on a task will mark it as completed, with a visual indication.
- **Delete Task**: Users can delete individual tasks from the list.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved to the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the application.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout of the app.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For the functionality of adding, deleting, and toggling task completion, as well as managing local storage.
- **Local Storage API**: Used to store tasks in the browser so that they remain after the page is refreshed.
